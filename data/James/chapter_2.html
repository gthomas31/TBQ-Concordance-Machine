<h3 class="subhead">A Warning against Prejudice</h3>
<p class="body-ch-hd"><span class="vn">1</span>My dear brothers and sisters,<a class="a-tn">*</a><span class="tn"><span class="tn-ref">2:1</span> Greek <em>brothers;</em> also in 2:5, 14.</span> how can you claim to have faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ if you favor some people over others?</p>
</verse_export><verse_export orig="jame_2_2" bk="jame" ch="2" vn="2">
<p class="body"><span class="vn">2</span>For example, suppose someone comes into your meeting<a class="a-tn">*</a><span class="tn"><span class="tn-ref">2:2</span> Greek <em>your synagogue.</em></span> dressed in fancy clothes and expensive jewelry, and another comes in who is poor and dressed in dirty clothes. </verse_export><verse_export orig="jame_2_3" bk="jame" ch="2" vn="3"><span class="vn">3</span>If you give special attention and a good seat to the rich person, but you say to the poor one, “You can stand over there, or else sit on the floor”—well, </verse_export><verse_export orig="jame_2_4" bk="jame" ch="2" vn="4"><span class="vn">4</span>doesn’t this discrimination show that your judgments are guided by evil motives?<p>
</verse_export><verse_export orig="jame_2_5" bk="jame" ch="2" vn="5">
<p class="body"><span class="vn">5</span>Listen to me, dear brothers and sisters. Hasn’t God chosen the poor in this world to be rich in faith? Aren’t they the ones who will inherit the Kingdom he promised to those who love him? </verse_export><verse_export orig="jame_2_6" bk="jame" ch="2" vn="6"><span class="vn">6</span>But you dishonor the poor! Isn’t it the rich who oppress you and drag you into court? </verse_export><verse_export orig="jame_2_7" bk="jame" ch="2" vn="7"><span class="vn">7</span>Aren’t they the ones who slander Jesus Christ, whose noble name<a class="a-tn">*</a><span class="tn"><span class="tn-ref">2:7</span> Greek <em>slander the noble name.</em></span> you bear?<p>
</verse_export><verse_export orig="jame_2_8" bk="jame" ch="2" vn="8">
<p class="body"><span class="vn">8</span>Yes indeed, it is good when you obey the royal law as found in the Scriptures: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”<a class="a-tn">*</a><span class="tn"><span class="tn-ref">2:8</span> Lev 19:18.</span> </verse_export><verse_export orig="jame_2_9" bk="jame" ch="2" vn="9"><span class="vn">9</span>But if you favor some people over others, you are committing a sin. You are guilty of breaking the law.<p>
</verse_export><verse_export orig="jame_2_10" bk="jame" ch="2" vn="10">
<p class="body"><span class="vn">10</span>For the person who keeps all of the laws except one is as guilty as a person who has broken all of God’s laws. </verse_export><verse_export orig="jame_2_11" bk="jame" ch="2" vn="11"><span class="vn">11</span>For the same God who said, “You must not commit adultery,” also said, “You must not murder.”<a class="a-tn">*</a><span class="tn"><span class="tn-ref">2:11</span> Exod 20:13-14; Deut 5:17-18.</span> So if you murder someone but do not commit adultery, you have still broken the law.<p>
</verse_export><verse_export orig="jame_2_12" bk="jame" ch="2" vn="12">
<p class="body"><span class="vn">12</span>So whatever you say or whatever you do, remember that you will be judged by the law that sets you free. </verse_export><verse_export orig="jame_2_13" bk="jame" ch="2" vn="13"><span class="vn">13</span>There will be no mercy for those who have not shown mercy to others. But if you have been merciful, God will be merciful when he judges you.<p>

<h3 class="subhead">Faith without Good Deeds Is Dead</h3>
<p class="body-hd"><span class="vn">14</span>What good is it, dear brothers and sisters, if you say you have faith but don’t show it by your actions? Can that kind of faith save anyone? </verse_export><verse_export orig="jame_2_15" bk="jame" ch="2" vn="15"><span class="vn">15</span>Suppose you see a brother or sister who has no food or clothing, </verse_export><verse_export orig="jame_2_16" bk="jame" ch="2" vn="16"><span class="vn">16</span>and you say, “Good-bye and have a good day; stay warm and eat well”—but then you don’t give that person any food or clothing. What good does that do?<p>
</verse_export><verse_export orig="jame_2_17" bk="jame" ch="2" vn="17">
<p class="body"><span class="vn">17</span>So you see, faith by itself isn’t enough. Unless it produces good deeds, it is dead and useless.</p>
</verse_export><verse_export orig="jame_2_18" bk="jame" ch="2" vn="18">
<p class="body"><span class="vn">18</span>Now someone may argue, “Some people have faith; others have good deeds.” But I say, “How can you show me your faith if you don’t have good deeds? I will show you my faith by my good deeds.”</p>
</verse_export><verse_export orig="jame_2_19" bk="jame" ch="2" vn="19">
<p class="body"><span class="vn">19</span>You say you have faith, for you believe that there is one God.<a class="a-tn">*</a><span class="tn"><span class="tn-ref">2:19</span> Some manuscripts read <em>that God is one;</em> see Deut 6:4.</span> Good for you! Even the demons believe this, and they tremble in terror. </verse_export><verse_export orig="jame_2_20" bk="jame" ch="2" vn="20"><span class="vn">20</span>How foolish! Can’t you see that faith without good deeds is useless?<p>
</verse_export><verse_export orig="jame_2_21" bk="jame" ch="2" vn="21">
<p class="body"><span class="vn">21</span>Don’t you remember that our ancestor Abraham was shown to be right with God by his actions when he offered his son Isaac on the altar? </verse_export><verse_export orig="jame_2_22" bk="jame" ch="2" vn="22"><span class="vn">22</span>You see, his faith and his actions worked together. His actions made his faith complete. </verse_export><verse_export orig="jame_2_23" bk="jame" ch="2" vn="23"><span class="vn">23</span>And so it happened just as the Scriptures say: “Abraham believed God, and God counted him as righteous because of his faith.”<a class="a-tn">*</a><span class="tn"><span class="tn-ref">2:23a</span> Gen 15:6.</span> He was even called the friend of God.<a class="a-tn">*</a><span class="tn"><span class="tn-ref">2:23b</span> See Isa 41:8.</span> </verse_export><verse_export orig="jame_2_24" bk="jame" ch="2" vn="24"><span class="vn">24</span>So you see, we are shown to be right with God by what we do, not by faith alone.<p>
</verse_export><verse_export orig="jame_2_25" bk="jame" ch="2" vn="25">
<p class="body"><span class="vn">25</span>Rahab the prostitute is another example. She was shown to be right with God by her actions when she hid those messengers and sent them safely away by a different road. </verse_export><verse_export orig="jame_2_26" bk="jame" ch="2" vn="26"><span class="vn">26</span>Just as the body is dead without breath,<a class="a-tn">*</a><span class="tn"><span class="tn-ref">2:26</span> Or <em>without spirit.</em></span> so also faith is dead without good works.<p>
