The very wealth you were counting on will eat away your flesh like fire.

Hear the cries of the field workers whom you have cheated of their pay. The cries of those who harvest your fields have reached the ears of the <span class="sc">Lord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.<p>

<p class="body"><span class="vn">5</span>You have spent your years on earth in luxury, satisfying your every desire.
