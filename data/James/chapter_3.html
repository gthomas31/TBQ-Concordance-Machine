<p class="body-ch-hd"><span class="vn">1</span>Dear brothers and sisters,<a class="a-tn">*</a><span class="tn"><span class="tn-ref">3:1</span> Greek <em>brothers;</em> also in 3:10.</span> not many of you should become teachers in the church, for we who teach will be judged more strictly. </verse_export><verse_export orig="jame_3_2" bk="jame" ch="3" vn="2"><span class="vn">2</span>Indeed, we all make many mistakes. For if we could control our tongues, we would be perfect and could also control ourselves in every other way.<p>

<p class="body"><span class="vn">3</span>We can make a large horse go wherever we want by means of a small bit in its mouth. </verse_export><verse_export orig="jame_3_4" bk="jame" ch="3" vn="4"><span class="vn">4</span>And a small rudder makes a huge ship turn wherever the pilot chooses to go, even though the winds are strong. </verse_export><verse_export orig="jame_3_5" bk="jame" ch="3" vn="5"><span class="vn">5</span>In the same way, the tongue is a small thing that makes grand speeches.<p>
<p class="body">But a tiny spark can set a great forest on fire. </verse_export><verse_export orig="jame_3_6" bk="jame" ch="3" vn="6"><span class="vn">6</span>And among all the parts of the body, the tongue is a flame of fire.

Such things are earthly, unspiritual, and demonic. </verse_export><verse_export orig="jame_3_16" bk="jame" ch="3" vn="16"><span class="vn">16</span>For wherever there is jealousy and selfish ambition, there you will find disorder and evil of every kind.<p>

<p class="body"><span class="vn">17</span>But the wisdom from above is first of all pure. It is also peace loving, gentle at all times, and willing to yield to others. It is full of mercy and the fruit of good deeds. It shows no favoritism and is always sincere. </verse_export><verse_export orig="jame_3_18" bk="jame" ch="3" vn="18"><span class="vn">18</span>And those who are peacemakers will plant seeds of peace and reap a harvest of righteousness.<a class="a-tn">*</a><span class="tn"><span class="tn-ref">3:18</span> Or <em>of good things,</em> or <em>of justice.</em></span><p>
