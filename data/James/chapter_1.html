<p class="body-hd"><span class="vn">2</span>Dear brothers and sisters,<a class="a-tn">*</a><span class="tn"><span class="tn-ref">1:2</span> Greek <em>brothers;</em> also in 1:16, 19.</span> when troubles of any kind come your way, consider it an opportunity for great joy. </verse_export><verse_export orig="jame_1_3" bk="jame" ch="1" vn="3"><span class="vn">3</span>For you know that when your faith is tested, your endurance has a chance to grow. </verse_export><verse_export orig="jame_1_4" bk="jame" ch="1" vn="4"><span class="vn">4</span>So let it grow, for when your endurance is fully developed, you will be perfect and complete, needing nothing.<p>

<p class="body"><span class="vn">5</span>If you need wisdom, ask our generous God, and he will give it to you. He will not rebuke you for asking. </verse_export><verse_export orig="jame_1_6" bk="jame" ch="1" vn="6"><span class="vn">6</span>But when you ask him, be sure that your faith is in God alone. Do not waver, for a person with divided loyalty is as unsettled as a wave of the sea that is blown and tossed by the wind. </verse_export><verse_export orig="jame_1_7" bk="jame" ch="1" vn="7"><span class="vn">7</span>Such people should not expect to receive anything from the Lord. </verse_export><verse_export orig="jame_1_8" bk="jame" ch="1" vn="8"><span class="vn">8</span>Their loyalty is divided between God and the world, and they are unstable in everything they do.<p>

<p class="body"><span class="vn">22</span>But don’t just listen to God’s word. You must do what it says. Otherwise, you are only fooling yourselves. </verse_export><verse_export orig="jame_1_23" bk="jame" ch="1" vn="23"><span class="vn">23</span>For if you listen to the word and don’t obey, it is like glancing at your face in a mirror. </verse_export><verse_export orig="jame_1_24" bk="jame" ch="1" vn="24"><span class="vn">24</span>You see yourself, walk away, and forget what you look like. </verse_export><verse_export orig="jame_1_25" bk="jame" ch="1" vn="25"><span class="vn">25</span>But if you look carefully into the perfect law that sets you free, and if you do what it says and don’t forget what you heard, then God will bless you for doing it.<p>

<p class="body"><span class="vn">26</span>If you claim to be religious but don’t control your tongue, you are fooling yourself, and your religion is worthless. </verse_export><verse_export orig="jame_1_27" bk="jame" ch="1" vn="27"><span class="vn">27</span>Pure and genuine religion in the sight of God the Father means caring for orphans and widows in their distress and refusing to let the world corrupt you.<p>
