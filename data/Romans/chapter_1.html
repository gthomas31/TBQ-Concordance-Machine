<h3 class="subhead">Greetings from Paul</h3>
<p class="body-ch-hd"><span class="vn">1</span>This letter is from Paul, a slave of Christ Jesus, chosen by God to be an apostle and sent out to preach his Good News. </verse_export><verse_export orig="roma_1_2" bk="roma" ch="1" vn="2"><span class="vn">2</span>God promised this Good News long ago through his prophets in the holy Scriptures. </verse_export><verse_export orig="roma_1_3" bk="roma" ch="1" vn="3"><span class="vn">3</span>The Good News is about his Son. In his earthly life he was born into King David’s family line, </verse_export><verse_export orig="roma_1_4" bk="roma" ch="1" vn="4"><span class="vn">4</span>and he was shown to be<a class="a-tn">*</a><span class="tn"><span class="tn-ref">1:4a</span> Or <em>and was designated.</em></span> the Son of God when he was raised from the dead by the power of the Holy Spirit.<a class="a-tn">*</a><span class="tn"><span class="tn-ref">1:4b</span> Or <em>by the Spirit of holiness;</em> or <em>in the new realm of the Spirit.</em></span> He is Jesus Christ our Lord. </verse_export><verse_export orig="roma_1_5" bk="roma" ch="1" vn="5"><span class="vn">5</span>Through Christ, God has given us the privilege<a class="a-tn">*</a><span class="tn"><span class="tn-ref">1:5</span> Or <em>the grace.</em></span> and authority as apostles to tell Gentiles everywhere what God has done for them, so that they will believe and obey him, bringing glory to his name.<p>
</verse_export><verse_export orig="roma_1_6" bk="roma" ch="1" vn="6">
<p class="body"><span class="vn">6</span>And you are included among those Gentiles who have been called to belong to Jesus Christ. </verse_export><verse_export orig="roma_1_7" bk="roma" ch="1" vn="7"><span class="vn">7</span>I am writing to all of you in Rome who are loved by God and are called to be his own holy people.<p>

<h3 class="subhead">God’s Good News</h3>
<p class="body-hd"><span class="vn">8</span>Let me say first that I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith in him is being talked about all over the world. </verse_export><verse_export orig="roma_1_9" bk="roma" ch="1" vn="9"><span class="vn">9</span>God knows how often I pray for you. Day and night I bring you and your needs in prayer to God, whom I serve with all my heart<a class="a-tn">*</a><span class="tn"><span class="tn-ref">1:9</span> Or <em>in my spirit.</em></span> by spreading the Good News about his Son.<p>
</verse_export><verse_export orig="roma_1_10" bk="roma" ch="1" vn="10">
<p class="body"><span class="vn">10</span>One of the things I always pray for is the opportunity, God willing, to come at last to see you. </verse_export><verse_export orig="roma_1_11" bk="roma" ch="1" vn="11"><span class="vn">11</span>For I long to visit you so I can bring you some spiritual gift that will help you grow strong in the Lord. </verse_export><verse_export orig="roma_1_12" bk="roma" ch="1" vn="12"><span class="vn">12</span>When we get together, I want to encourage you in your faith, but I also want to be encouraged by yours.<p>
</verse_export><verse_export orig="roma_1_13" bk="roma" ch="1" vn="13">
<p class="body"><span class="vn">13</span>I want you to know, dear brothers and sisters,<a class="a-tn">*</a><span class="tn"><span class="tn-ref">1:13</span> Greek <em>brothers.</em></span> that I planned many times to visit you, but I was prevented until now. I want to work among you and see spiritual fruit, just as I have seen among other Gentiles. </verse_export><verse_export orig="roma_1_14" bk="roma" ch="1" vn="14"><span class="vn">14</span>For I have a great sense of obligation to people in both the civilized world and the rest of the world,<a class="a-tn">*</a><span class="tn"><span class="tn-ref">1:14</span> Greek <em>to Greeks and barbarians.</em></span> to the educated and uneducated alike. </verse_export><verse_export orig="roma_1_15" bk="roma" ch="1" vn="15"><span class="vn">15</span>So I am eager to come to you in Rome, too, to preach the Good News.<p>
</verse_export><verse_export orig="roma_1_16" bk="roma" ch="1" vn="16">
<p class="body"><span class="vn">16</span>For I am not ashamed of this Good News about Christ. It is the power of God at work, saving everyone who believes—the Jew first and also the Gentile.<a class="a-tn">*</a><span class="tn"><span class="tn-ref">1:16</span> Greek <em>also the Greek.</em></span> </verse_export><verse_export orig="roma_1_17" bk="roma" ch="1" vn="17"><span class="vn">17</span>This Good News tells us how God makes us right in his sight. This is accomplished from start to finish by faith. As the Scriptures say, “It is through faith that a righteous person has life.”<a class="a-tn">*</a><span class="tn"><span class="tn-ref">1:17</span> Or <em>“The righteous will live by faith.”</em> Hab 2:4.</span><p>

<h3 class="subhead">God’s Anger at Sin</h3>
<p class="body-hd"><span class="vn">18</span>But God shows his anger from heaven against all sinful, wicked people who suppress the truth by their wickedness.<a class="a-tn">*</a><span class="tn"><span class="tn-ref">1:18</span> Or <em>who, by their wickedness, prevent the truth from being known.</em></span> </verse_export><verse_export orig="roma_1_19" bk="roma" ch="1" vn="19"><span class="vn">19</span>They know the truth about God because he has made it obvious to them. </verse_export><verse_export orig="roma_1_20" bk="roma" ch="1" vn="20"><span class="vn">20</span>For ever since the world was created, people have seen the earth and sky. Through everything God made, they can clearly see his invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature. So they have no excuse for not knowing God.<p>
</verse_export><verse_export orig="roma_1_21" bk="roma" ch="1" vn="21">
<p class="body"><span class="vn">21</span>Yes, they knew God, but they wouldn’t worship him as God or even give him thanks. And they began to think up foolish ideas of what God was like. As a result, their minds became dark and confused. </verse_export><verse_export orig="roma_1_22" bk="roma" ch="1" vn="22"><span class="vn">22</span>Claiming to be wise, they instead became utter fools. </verse_export><verse_export orig="roma_1_23" bk="roma" ch="1" vn="23"><span class="vn">23</span>And instead of worshiping the glorious, ever-living God, they worshiped idols made to look like mere people and birds and animals and reptiles.<p>
</verse_export><verse_export orig="roma_1_24" bk="roma" ch="1" vn="24">
<p class="body"><span class="vn">24</span>So God abandoned them to do whatever shameful things their hearts desired. As a result, they did vile and degrading things with each other’s bodies. </verse_export><verse_export orig="roma_1_25" bk="roma" ch="1" vn="25"><span class="vn">25</span>They traded the truth about God for a lie. So they worshiped and served the things God created instead of the Creator himself, who is worthy of eternal praise! Amen. </verse_export><verse_export orig="roma_1_26" bk="roma" ch="1" vn="26"><span class="vn">26</span>That is why God abandoned them to their shameful desires. Even the women turned against the natural way to have sex and instead indulged in sex with each other. </verse_export><verse_export orig="roma_1_27" bk="roma" ch="1" vn="27"><span class="vn">27</span>And the men, instead of having normal sexual relations with women, burned with lust for each other. Men did shameful things with other men, and as a result of this sin, they suffered within themselves the penalty they deserved.<p>
</verse_export><verse_export orig="roma_1_28" bk="roma" ch="1" vn="28">
<p class="body"><span class="vn">28</span>Since they thought it foolish to acknowledge God, he abandoned them to their foolish thinking and let them do things that should never be done. </verse_export><verse_export orig="roma_1_29" bk="roma" ch="1" vn="29"><span class="vn">29</span>Their lives became full of every kind of wickedness, sin, greed, hate, envy, murder, quarreling, deception, malicious behavior, and gossip. </verse_export><verse_export orig="roma_1_30" bk="roma" ch="1" vn="30"><span class="vn">30</span>They are backstabbers, haters of God, insolent, proud, and boastful. They invent new ways of sinning, and they disobey their parents. </verse_export><verse_export orig="roma_1_31" bk="roma" ch="1" vn="31"><span class="vn">31</span>They refuse to understand, break their promises, are heartless, and have no mercy. </verse_export><verse_export orig="roma_1_32" bk="roma" ch="1" vn="32"><span class="vn">32</span>They know God’s justice requires that those who do these things deserve to die, yet they do them anyway. Worse yet, they encourage others to do them, too.<p>
