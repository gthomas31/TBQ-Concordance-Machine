<p class="body-ch-hd"><span class="vn">1</span>You may think you can condemn such people, but you are just as bad, and you have no excuse! When you say they are wicked and should be punished, you are condemning yourself, for you who judge others do these very same things. </verse_export><verse_export orig="roma_2_2" bk="roma" ch="2" vn="2"><span class="vn">2</span>And we know that God, in his justice, will punish anyone who does such things. </verse_export><verse_export orig="roma_2_3" bk="roma" ch="2" vn="3"><span class="vn">3</span>Since you judge others for doing these things, why do you think you can avoid God’s judgment when you do the same things? </verse_export><verse_export orig="roma_2_4" bk="roma" ch="2" vn="4"><span class="vn">4</span>Don’t you see how wonderfully kind, tolerant, and patient God is with you? Does this mean nothing to you? Can’t you see that his kindness is intended to turn you from your sin?<p>
</verse_export><verse_export orig="roma_2_5" bk="roma" ch="2" vn="5">
<p class="body"><span class="vn">5</span>But because you are stubborn and refuse to turn from your sin, you are storing up terrible punishment for yourself.
